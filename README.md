### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of the application is allow users to enter their current weight and a goal weight. As the user's weight decreases, or increases, they are able to add a new entry. The user is able to also view a list of all of their entries and can make edits as they see fit.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens and features that were necessary to support the user needs included an account registration screen (the main activity), login screen, a home activity screen, and a list view screen. Each of these screens appear based on what buttons the user clicks. For example, when the app first starts, the registration page appears because it is the main activity. If the user already has an account, they will see the login button with a message that reads "Already have an account?". All the UI designs keep the user in mind.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My approach involved building the UI first. This approach made it easier to develop the user database and the weight database later on. Each time I created a method that required a database query in a Java activity file, I went to my database helper files and created the query. This strategy helped me keep track of what I was working on throughout the process.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure my code was functional, I ran the emulator and opened the console to check for errors. I also logged messages to the console when weights were added, edited, or deleted from the weights database. This was a very important process because it would reveal errors I missed before the emulator would run, or reveal the issue when the emulator crashed.

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
My main challenge was with the databases I developed. I utilized the Android Studio documentation, but I also took advantage of other resources to assist me until I later recognized the pattern.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successful in the design of the mobile app. At first I had a bit of a challenge understanding how to create layouts because it's completely different from using HTML and CSS. I utilized several resources to help me better understand the different layout styles available in Android Studio and the best practices for each.
